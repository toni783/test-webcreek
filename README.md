# TestWebcreek

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.


### Prerequisites

```
Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.

To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.

To get Node.js, go to nodejs.org.
```

```
Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages. To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.

This Quick Start uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default.

To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal/console window.
```

```
Install the Angular CLI globally.

To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:

content_copy
npm install -g @angular/cli

```
